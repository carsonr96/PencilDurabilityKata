# PencilDurabilityKata
This is my program for the Pillar application process. 
In order to run all of this, you must import it into any Java IDE and run the file and input a text string of your choice. 
All of the tests are located in the PencilTest.java file and will run once you enter the string.

You may also test different lengths for the pencil or durability of the graphite by changing the number from what is set to any number. 
I am unable to figure out how to cut it off after it surpasses the durability number.
However, it does count down and increment through the steps with sharpening and shortening the length. 

I used Netbeans to develop it as that is what I have used the most. 

I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.
