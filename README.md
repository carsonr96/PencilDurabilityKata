# PencilDurabilityKata
This is my program for the Pillar application process. 
In order to run all of this, you must import it into any Java IDE and run the file and input a text string of your choice. 
All of the tests are located in the PencilTest.java file and will run once you enter the string. 

I used Netbeans to develop it as that is what I have used the most.
